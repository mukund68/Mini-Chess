# Mini-Chess
Introduction:
The project is based on mechanism of chess in which only pawns are considered. In this game, we allow two players to play mini chess.

How to play?

First we have to enter the row and column number of the pawn which we want to move.
Then for white pawn we choose between 3 options which are straight down, down left or down right.
In case of the black pawn, the choice is straight up, up left or up right.
The compiler runs and executes the program; displaying the board in output.
If the input is wrong, then an error will be displayed on the screen and the user will have to re enter the input.
The program also displays all the number of possible moves of a player.
After a move has been made by the white pawn; the user controlling the black pawn will be asked about his consequent proceedings

Conditions to win:

1. If any player is not able to move, the opponent wins.
2. If the pawn of one color reaches the starting row of another color, the corresponding player wins.
3. If no pawn of any player is alive(available), the oppoenent wins.
